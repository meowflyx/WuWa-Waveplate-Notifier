A simple, asynchronous Telegram bot to track **Waveplate** (stamina) regeneration in _Wuthering Waves_. It calculates real-time regeneration and notifies you exactly when your stamina hits the cap (240), so you don't waste resources.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This codebase was entirely generated by an AI assistant. It implements precise mathematical calculation for stamina regeneration rather than a simple countdown timer.
> ⚠️ **Note 2:** Author of this repository is hosting this bot for himself too. If you don't want to host it, you may check whether `@wuwawpnotifier_bot` in telegram is online.

## ✨ Features

- **Real-time Calculation:** Doesn't just count down seconds. It stores a timestamp and calculates your current Waveplates based on the server regeneration rate (1 WP per 6 minutes).
- **Persistent State:** If the bot restarts (and you add a database), it knows exactly how much you regenerated while it was offline.
- **Smart Notifications:** Pings you exactly when you hit 240/240.
- **Quick Actions:**
  - `I just spent it ALL`: Instantly resets counter to 0 and schedules a reminder for 24 hours later.
  - `Refresh Status`: Shows current count and exact time until full cap.
- **AsyncIO:** Built on `python-telegram-bot` v20+, using `JobQueue` for non-blocking execution.

## 🛠️ Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/wuwa-waveplate-bot.git](https://github.com/your-username/wuwa-waveplate-bot.git)
    cd wuwa-waveplate-bot
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    You need the modern `python-telegram-bot` library.

    ```bash
    pip install python-telegram-bot --upgrade
    ```

3.  **Configuration:**
    Open `wuwa_bot.py` and replace the placeholder with your token:
    ```python

## 🚀 Usage

1.  **Run the bot:**

    ```bash
    python wuwa_bot.py
    ```

2.  **Commands:**
    - `/start` - Initialize the tracker and show the control panel.
    - `/set <amount>` - Manually set your current Waveplates (e.g., `/set 45` if you just logged in and checked).

3.  **Buttons:**
    - **🌊 I just spent it ALL**: Click this immediately after doing your dailies/Tacet Fields.
    - **🔄 Refresh Status**: Check your current regeneration status without altering the timer.

## ⚙️ Technical Details

- **Regeneration Rate:** 1 unit per 6 minutes.
- **Cap:** 240 units.
- **Formula:** $T_{wait} = (240 - Current_{WP}) \times 6 \text{ minutes}$
